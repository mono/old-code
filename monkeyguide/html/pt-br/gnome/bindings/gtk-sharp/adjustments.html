<p>Gtk# has various widgets that can be visually adjusted by the
user using the mouse or the keyboard, such as the range widgets,
described in the Range Widgets section. There are also a few
widgets that display some adjustable portion of a larger area of
data, such as the text widget and the viewport widget.</p>
<p>Obviously, an application needs to be able to react to changes
the user makes in range widgets. One way to do this would be to
have each widget emit its own type of signal when its adjustment
changes, and either pass the new value to the signal handler, or
require it to look inside the widget's data structure in order to
ascertain the value. But you may also want to connect the
adjustments of several widgets together, so that adjusting one
adjusts the others. The most obvious example of this is connecting
a scrollbar to a panning viewport or a scrolling text area. If each
widget has its own way of setting or getting the adjustment value,
then the programmer may have to write their own signal handlers to
translate between the output of one widget's signal and the "input"
of another's adjustment setting function.</p>
<p>Gtk# solves this problem using the Adjustment object, which is
not a widget but a way for widgets to store and pass adjustment
information in an abstract and flexible form. The most obvious use
of Adjustment is to store the configuration parameters and values
of range widgets, such as scrollbars and scale controls. However,
since Adjustments are derived from Object, they have some special
powers beyond those of normal data structures. Most importantly,
they can emit signals, just like widgets, and these signals can be
used not only to allow your program to react to user input on
adjustable widgets, but also to propagate adjustment values
transparently between adjustable widgets.</p>
<p>You will see how adjustments fit in when you see the other
widgets that incorporate them: Progress Bars, Viewports, Scrolled
Windows, and others.</p>
