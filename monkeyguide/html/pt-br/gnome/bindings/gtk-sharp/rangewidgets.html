<p>The category of range widgets includes the ubiquitous scrollbar
widget and the less common scale widget. Though these two types of
widgets are generally used for different purposes, they are quite
similar in function and implementation. All range widgets share a
set of common graphic elements, each of which has its own X window
and receives events. They all contain a "trough" and a "slider"
(what is sometimes called a "thumbwheel" in other GUI
environments). Dragging the slider with the pointer moves it back
and forth within the trough, while clicking in the trough advances
the slider towards the location of the click, either completely, or
by a designated amount, depending on which mouse button is
used.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Adjustments above, all range widgets are
associated with an adjustment object, from which they calculate the
length of the slider and its position within the trough. When the
user manipulates the slider, the range widget will change the value
of the adjustment.</p>
