2008-10-05  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-htmlutils.xsl: 
	  - `struct' constraints shouldn't also print out `ValueType, new()' 
	    as constraints, as these are automatically implied.  
	  - Change the method sort order so that generic methods are sorted 
	    first by name, then by *number* of generic parameters, then by 
	    *name* of generic parameters (so that rocks-playground 
	    .Curry<T1,T2> are sorted together and not interspersed with the
	    dozens of other .Curry() overloads...).
	  - Fixup Parameter type sorting, as it was only sorting by the 
	    *first* parameter type when the number of parameters matched.

2008-09-19  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl (GetMemberArgList): Properly handle deeply nested
	  generic types.  Before, KeyValuePair<IEnumerable<A>, IEnumerable<B>>
	  would become KeyValuePair<IEnumerable<A>, S.C.G.IEnumerable<B>> --
	  that is, we'd get full namespace names for everything but the first
	  generic parameter.

2008-05-06 Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: fix make dist
	The directories were getting created by adding files to the dist list
	so use mkdir -p so we don't fail.

2008-05-02  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* mono-ecma-css.xsl: Align the image properly

2008-05-02  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* provider.cs: Get an image stream that is stored in monodoc itself
	  (and not in one of the help sources). This is for plus/minus images
	  support
	* mono-ecma-css.xsl: Remove the border from the images
	* helper.js: The added comment with the full img tag is a hack to get
	  the GeckoHtmlRender to cache unloaded images (it searches for <img
	  tags, which in the case of the Lplus.gif image is non-existent on
	  initial load but is loaded later through javascript)
	* Makefile.am: Add Lplus.gif and Lminus.gif images to the monodoc.dll
	  resources (should they go somewhere else? where?)
	* mono-ecma-css.js: This code is already loaded on helper.js, so don't
	  load it here

2008-04-28  Andreia Gaita <avidigal@novell.com> 

	* provider.cs, helper.js, Makefile.am: Added resource script for block
	  toggles on the generated documentation

2008-04-20  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* error-provider.cs: Ensure we dispose StreamReader's when we're done with 
	them.  Otherwise we can get into a race exhausting available file handles 
	with the gc.

2008-04-15  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* assembler.cs: Don't create a new EcmaProvider for each directory, but
	  instead re-use the same instance and call .AddDirectory() for them.  This
	  allows us to e.g. only insert one xml.summary.Namespace and
	  mastersummary.xml file (instead of one per assembly-directory, as was
	  previously the case, resulting in potentially incomplete mastersummary.xml
	  files and complaints about overwriting existing files during unzipping).
	* ecma-provider.cs: 
	  - Allow a single EcmaProvider instance to handle multiple directories, 
	    instead of just one (see above for why).
	  - Add an ExtensionMethods.xml file into the .zip package which contains 
	    all the <ExtensionMethod/> elements from the assembly-level index.xml 
	    files.
	  - Insert all extension methods within monodoc into the type-level xml file
	    so that the XSLT can display the extension methods within the browser.
	  - Add support for a T:.../X URL to show supported extension methods.
	* Makefile.am: Add XmlDocUtils.cs to the bulid.
	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: Generate a new 'Extension Methods' section which
	  contains all extension methods for the specified type (which are inserted
	  by ecma-provider.cs before this XSLT runs).
	* mono-ecma-impl.xsl: Add a link for extension methods.
	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Add support for index.xml's /Overview/ExtensionMethods
	  element; add a //Member/Link element (used by mdoc-html-utils.xsl to
	  generate proper links to the extension method's documentation within the
	  class' summary table).
	* provider.cs: Add a HelpSource.RootTree field so that the HelpSource can
	  obtain the RootTree which loaded the HelpSource.  This is so
	  EcmaHelpSource can enumerate all other EcmaHelpSources loaded and provide
	  *all* available extension methods across all documented assemblies.
	* XmlDocUtils.cs: Added; XML documentation utility methods, used to add
	  extension method elements to type documentation.
	* Test/validate.check.monodocer.importslashdoc: Add additional errors.

2008-04-09  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: The 2008-04-04 fix to SkipGenericArgument() was
	  incorrect, as it thought that the CREF for EventHandler<Foo<T>+Helper> was
	  EventHandler`1.Helper, not EventHandler`1 (oops).  Fix this.

2008-04-08  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: 
	  - `id' attributes should contain a proper CREF-like string.
	  - Generate [return:...] attributes for delegate/methods.
	  - Generate attributes for generic parameters within type/member signatures.
	  - Generate generic argument constraints within signatures.
	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Add //TypeParameter/Attributes and
	  //TypeParameter/Constraints elements.

2008-04-05  Mario Sopena Novales <mario.sopena@gmail.com>

	* provider.cs: 
		- Clean RootTree from nodes without documentation and children without
		documentation
		- Generate a simple index for nodes without documentation which have
		children with documentation

2008-04-04  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: SkipGenericArgument() didn't propertly skip generic
	  nested types as in EventHandler<Foo<T>+Helper>; fix this.

2008-03-31  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: Fix Array handling behavior -- not all types with '[]'
	  are actually arrays (IEnumerable<int[]> isn't an array), and '[]' isn't
	  the only array suffix either ('[,]' and other are as well). Fixes 375291.

2008-03-26  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsd: Split out explicitly implemented interface members
	  into a separate section, distinct from properties, methods, etc. (mostly to
	  keep them from cluttering up the other sections), and sort the explicitly
	  implemented members according to the member name and not the type name.

2008-03-26  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: 
	  - Permit actual line wrapping within the table for explicitly-implemented 
	    properties and methods by (1) shortening common names (e.g. 
	    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T> -> IEnumerable<T>) and adding 
	    a space after commas, so Foo<A,B> --> Foo<A, B>.  This way, explicitly 
	    implemented members like Dictionary`2's 
	    System.Collections.Generic.ICollection&lt;System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;&gt;.IsReadOnly
	    property won't require a horizontal scrollbar.
	  - Remove leading/trailing whitespace from //see[@cref] links, so that the
	    generated a[@href] links don't have extra whitespace, otherwise 
	    rendering them invalid.

2008-03-25  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma-css.js: Remove image flickering by directly modifying the
	  img/@src attribute instead of using the innerHTML property.

2008-03-25  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma-impl.xsl: Don't provide the $edit parameter.  Remove
	  the match="*|@*" handler, and implement CreateEditLink().
	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: Remove the $edit parameter from templates, and
	  instead *always* invoke the "editlink" handler, which now will call out to
	  CreateEditLink() to implement the actual link.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* web/monodoc.ashx: Explicitly set EnableEditing=false so that the [Edit]
	  links aren't displayed.
	* mono-ecma-impl.xsl: The "edit" parameters should be controlled by
	  monodoc:MonoEditing() so that web/monodoc.ashx can disable [Edit] support.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma-css.xsl, mono-ecma-css.js: Use <img/> instead of Unicode 
	  U+229E/U+229F.
	* mdoc-sections-css.xsl: Use a callback instead of using U+229E/U+229F.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* man-provider.cs: Display an index of all man pages for this HelpSource
	  when the "root:" URL is requested.  This allows viewing all sub-nodes
	  without using the tree.

2008-03-24  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: Create proper ID strings for explicitly implemented
	  members (where "proper" == "what .NET 'csc /doc' generates").
	* ecma-provider.cs: Support lookup of explicitly implemented members.

2008-03-23  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma-impl.xsl: Remove instances of Foo+Bar nested types and display
	  Foo.Bar instead; use the proper (base) class name when creating the link 
	  for (base) class members (i.e. correct href's are now generated).
	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: Ensure that the "See Also: <Type> Members" link does
	  an s/\+/./g for proper C# nested type syntax (Foo.Bar instead of Foo+Bar).

2008-03-23  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Kill performance. :-)  The "problem" is that ECMA-334
	  Appendix E.3.1 "ID string format" specifies that nested types use '.' to
	  separate the types, e.g. 'namespace N { class O { class I {} } }' would
	  have the ID string 'T:N.O.I'.  This breaks EcmaHelpSource.GetUrlForType()
	  et. al because these functions expect '+' to be used as the separator, so
	  attempting to enter T:N.O.I would result in N.O being the namespace and I
	  as the type, while we actually need N as the namespace and O.I as the
	  type.  Work around this by trying both N.O and N as the namespace (and
	  conseqeuntly both I and O.I as the type names) when looking for the
	  eventual URL to return.
	  - Pro: this allows us to click on links to nested types and actually view
	    the correct documentation.
	  - Con: Before we had to look at all Namespace nodes and all type nodes
	    within a namespace.  Now, we look at all namespace nodes and all type
	    nodes for all namespaces matching the "current" and "parent" namespaces --
	    e.g. for System.Collections.Generic.List`1.Enumerator we look at all types
	    in the namespaces: System, System.Collections, System.Collections.Generic,
	    System.Collections.Generic.List`1, until we find a match.

2008-03-22  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use xsp instead of xsp2.
	* ManifestResourceResolver.cs: Don't use the Uri(string, UriKind)
	  constructor, as that's .NET 2.0 specific (and we're reverting to using mcs
	  with the .NET 1.0 profile for the build).

2008-03-19  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma.css: Make the section hyperlinks not look like hyperlinks, as
	  the '[+]'/'[-]' provides enough context to know that they're clickble.

2008-03-17  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: <para/> shouldn't be able to contain <example/>, as it
	  doesn't make any sense.  This also prevents <summary/> from being able to
	  have an <example/>, which (again) doesn't make sense.

2008-03-17  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Permit the new /Overview/Types/Namespace/Type/@Kind
	  attribute that monodocer now generates.

2008-03-16  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Allow it to properly handle cref's of the form
	  Namespace.TypeName{GenericArgs}... in addition to
	  Namespace.TypeName<GenericArgs>....
	* Makefile.am: Allow monodoc.dll to build if mono.snk doesn't already exist
	  in the build directory.

2008-03-15  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Add a js_code static property; use
	  typeof(EcmaHelpSource) instead of Assembly.GetCallingAssembly(), as the
	  former occasionally fails (getting the assembly of the *caller* of the
	  property, not the assembly of the property itself).  
	  Improve cref resolution.
	* Makefile.am: Improve the resources description of monodoc.dll; add
	  ManifestResourceResolver.cs as a source file for monodoc.dll.
	* ManifestResourceResolver.cs: Added; allows .xsl files to refer to other
	  .xsl files (via e.g. <xsl:include/>) that are located within the same
	  assembly instead of a file on-disk.
	* mdoc-html-utils.xsl: Added; refactoring of mono-ecma-impl.xsl and
	  ../tools/stylesheet.xsl.
	* mdoc-sections.xsl, mdoc-sections-css.xsl: Added; common implementation of
	  mono-html-utils.xsl/mono-ecma-impl.xsl required functions.
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Refactor into mdoc-sections.xsl; remove C# syntax coloring
	  as it broke for some yet-undiagnosed reason (disble-output-escaping isn't
	  actually disabling output escaping :-(.
	* mono-ecma-css.js: Added; JavaScript used to expand/collapse sections
	  within the CSS-enabled HTML output.
	* mono-ecma-css.xsl: Refactor into mdoc-sections-css.xsl; remove C# syntax 
	  coloring as it broke for some yet-undiagnosed reason (disble-output-escaping
	  isn't actually disabling output escaping :-(.
	* mono-ecma-impl.xsl: Refactor into mdoc-html-utils.xsl.
	* provider.cs: Add FullHtml static property so that web/monodoc.ashx can
	  control whether "full" HTML is generated (e.g. the <html><body>...
	  wrapper, which web/monodoc.ashx does NOT need as it generates its own
	  wrapper).
	* web/monodoc.ashx: Enable CSS output for added bling; support JavaScript
	  internal URLs; insert the EcmaHelpSource CSS & JavaScript code.

2008-03-14  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: use mcs, not mcs1.  depend on .snk
	* Assembly.cs.in: don't delay sign.

2008-03-12  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am (web): Fix so that we don't get authentication errors due to
	  web/web.config's //authentication element.

2008-03-12  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma.css: Remove unused classes; add mono-ecma-css.xsl classes
	  previously in web/common.css.
	* mono-ecma.xsl, mono-ecma-css.xsl, mono-ecma-impl.xsl: The previous
	  refactor made GtkHtml output look bad -- add/implement more callbacks to
	  improve the output.
	* web/common.css: Remove classes used by mono-ecma-css.xsl, as these need to
	  be within mono-ecma.css.

2008-03-11  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* mono-ecma.xsl, mono-ecma-css.xsl: Refactor common code into
	  mono-ecma-impl.xsl; import mono-ecma-impl.xsl.
	* mono-ecma-impl.xsl: Added; common code for ecma->html conversion, shared
	  between mono-ecma.xsl and mono-ecma-css.xsl.
	* Makefile.am: Add .PHONY for non-file targets; add mono-ecma-impl.xsl as a
	  resource to monodoc.dll.
	* web/common.css: Add additional classes now used by mono-ecma-impl.xsl.

2008-03-04  Mario Sopena Novales <mario.sopena@gmail.com>
		* provider.cs, mono-ecma-css.xsl, mono-ecma.xsl, ecma-provider.cs:
		  allow namespace edition (#319116)

2008-03-03  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use xsp2 to run the web site, as we're targeting .NET 2.0 now.

2008-03-01  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* man-provider.cs: The fix to let `man:mdoc(1)` work broke the tree view; fix.

2008-03-01  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* man-provider.cs: Indenting cleanup; only add a man page node if the man
	  page actually exists (allows us to always build the man pages, and just
	  skip the mono man pages if there isn't a suitable mono checkout); set the
	  node entry_name so that `man:[//manpage/@name]` can be used in the monodoc
	  location dialog (e.g. man:mdoc(1) will load the mdoc(1) man page).

2008-02-29  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* man-provider.cs: Improve the .TH translation so that ".TH mcs 1" is
	  rendered as "mcs(1)", as man does it.  Extra information is right-aligned,
	  so ".TH mcs 1 6 January 2001" is "mcs(1)   6 January 2001".
	* Test/man-test1.html, Test/man-test2.html, Test/man-test3.html,
	  Test/man-test4.html: Flush.

2008-02-29  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* man-provider.cs: Remove leading & trailing quotes from quoted expressions,
	  so `.I "quoted string"` becomes <i>quoted string</i>.
	* Test/man-test1.html, Test/man-test2.html, Test/man-test3.html,
	  Test/man-test4.html: Flush.

2008-02-29  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* man-provider.cs: Near complete rewrite; make the output suck less.  In
	  particular, allow text with <>& to be displayed correctly; fix indenting.
	* Makefile.am: Corrections to pass distcheck; move validate test files into
	  Test; add tests for man-provider.cs
	* validate.check.monodocer: Moved to Test/validate.check.monodocer.
	* validate.check.monodocer.importslashdoc: Moved to 
	  Test/validate.check.monodocer.importslashdoc; remove full path information
	  so that the test will pass on other machines, distcheck.
	* validate.check.monodocer.since: Moved to Test/validate.check.monodocer.since
	* Test (svn:ignore): Ignore generated files.
	* Test/man-provider-test.cs: man-provider test runner.
	* Test/man-test1.1, Test/man-test2.1, Test/man-test3.1, Test/man-test4.1,
	  Test/man-test1.html, Test/man-test2.html, Test/man-test3.html,
	  Test/man-test4.html: Added; man input & HTML output for man-provider.

2008-02-21  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* assembler.cs, normalize.cs, validate.cs: Change namespace; make types &
	  Main() methods public so that they can be re-used by mdoc.cs.
	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Allow <Return/> elements to contain an <Attributes/>
	  element, to contain [return:] custom attributes.

2008-01-14  Jonathan Pryor  <jpryor@novell.com>

	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Permit the current monodocer-output of having multiple
	  <AssemblyVersion/> elements.

2008-01-08  Mario Sopena <mario.sopena@gmail.com>
	* engine/mono-ecma-css.xsl: see below
	* engine/mono-ecma.xsl: Allow editing Exception (see bug #319813) and
	  Permissions section

2008-01-02  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Look for namespace docs in both ns-<Namespace>.xml and
	  <Namespace>.xml files (the former is current monodocer output, the latter
	  is "legacy" output).

2007-12-18  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* mono-ecma.xsl: 
	  - For "mixed-access" properties, show the correct accessibility (e.g. 
	    "public int Width { protected set; get; }" is a public property; 
	    previously, this would be listed as a Protected property, and the 
	    property prototype would be "public protected int Width { protected
	    set; get; }", which is just wrong.
	  - Use a section name of e.g. "Public Properties", not just "Properties".
	  - `new' methods should be marked as `new', not `override'.

2007-12-17  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@novell.com>
	
	* assembler.cs, provider.cs, addins-provider.cs, Makefile.am:
	Added new provider which generates documentation for Mono.Addins
	extension models.
	* monodoc.xml: Added help source for the MonoDevelop extension model.
	
2007-12-12  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* provider.cs: Permit "relaxed" type/member URL lookup.  Many of the
	  imported ECMA docs have "malformed" urls like "T: Namespace.Type" (note
	  the space after the "T:"), which causes type/member lookup to fail.
	  Permit whitespace to follow the ':' so that lookup works as expected.

2007-12-11  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Remove <AssemblyVersions/> element, and just use
	  <AssemblyInfo/> under <Member/>.
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Show Requirements section for both members and types, not
	  just types; improve Requirements display to include an Assembly Versions
	  section, so that we can see in which assembly versions the member exists.

2007-12-11  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Add support for <Member/>-level and
	  <AssemblyInfo/>-level <AssemblyVersions/> element (with nested
	  <AssemblyVersion/> element), so that mdvalidater accepts current monodoc
	  output.

2007-02-02  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am : explicitly use utf-8. It does not build on Windows.

2006-12-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs (ExtensionObject): Quiet some of the
	implementation notes as they are often incorrect (MonoTODOs does
	not mean not implemented).

2006-12-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs (ExtensionObject): Quiet some of the
	implementation notes as they are often incorrect (MonoTODOs does
	not mean not implemented).
	
2006-11-20  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* web/monodoc.ashx: Small improvements, in preparation for the
	other editing work.

2006-11-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* xhtml-provider.cs: Track all the files that have been packed.

	Also pack the CSS reference files, warn the
	user if the file is not found.

	This code must be completely rewritten, and we should drop
	XHTML-only support, and depend on the AgilityPack.

2006-11-01  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Add check, check-validate, check-validate-update targets.
	* monodoc-ecma.xsd: Update for ECMA-334 and ECMA-335 3rd edition (add
	  <typeparam/>, <typeparamref/>, and other changes to better approximate the
	  ECMA-335 DTD) and monodoc Generics support (TypeParameters, etc.).
	  Also adds support for the index.xml and NamespaceName.xml files generated
	  by monodocer, so it should be possible to do 
	  `mdvalidator ecma class/corlib/en` and not get overwhelmed with errors
	  from these files.
	* validate.cs: Reduce output, so that no output is generated processing
	  files that have no errors.
	* validate.check.monodocer, validate.check.monodocer.importslashdoc, 
	  validate.check.monodocer.since: Added; expected output when running
	  against the ../tools/DocTest/en.expected* directories.

2006-10-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* provider.cs: Do not call chmod on non-Unix.

2006-10-06  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Properly handle situation when
	  index.xml/Overview/Types/Namespace/Type/@DisplayName doesn't exist
	  (Removes NullReferenceException).

2006-10-06  Jonathan Pryor  <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Add support for generic types.  
	  Use RootTree.GetNamespaceAndType() to do the namespace/type splitting.  
	  Add support to "escape" generic types, converting e.g. F<T,U> into 
	  F`2 (which is the on-disk filename).  
	  Use index.xml/Overview/Types/Namespace/Type/@File to load files on-disk.
	* provider.cs: Make GetNamespaceAndType() static; adapt
	  GetNamespaceAndType() to properly handle generic types, so that when given
	  Namespace.Foo<System.Int32>, it properly returns "Namespace" as the
	  namespace, not "Namespace.Foo<System".
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Display Type Parameters.

2006-07-23 Pablo Orduña <pablo@ordunya.com>

	* server.cs: Fix various uses of sql injection in the server code,
	this code has already been deployed in the server.

2006-06-19 Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com>

2005-05-21 Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	When loading EcmaUncompiledHelpSources, don't
	created the help source in browser.cs because it
	needs to be created and added to help_sources at the
	same time, because of the static id variable being
	incremented in the HelpSource constructor. The
	browser GUI is affected too.
	  
	* provider.cs: Hold on to the paths to uncompiled

	it to hang debugger info.

2005-01-24  Joshua Tauberer  <tauberer@for.net>
	
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Indent the namespace summaries with blockquote.
	  Show namespace-relative type names in the namespace remarks
	  sections.
	* ecma-provider.cs: Since there are namespace Xml files repeated
	  in the different assembly directories, Monodoc would use the
	  last one, whereas only one would have the real namespace
	  summary/remarks.  Now it ignores an Xml file if it contains
	  an empty or "To be added." namespace summary.

2005-01-22  Joshua Tauberer  <tauberer@for.net>

	* ecma-provider.cs: For editing, generating XPath locations
	of the edited node was different for properties than methods/
	constructors, but it should have been the same since properties
	can have parameters too.  It made some indexers uneditable.
	(I meant to commit this at least a month ago.)
	* browser.cs: Renamed the local XML docs editing feature to
	  simply '--edit'
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Cosmetic change to [Edit] links.

	makes a simple table of contents for the root page.

2004-12-01  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am (monodoc_gtk_data): Rename from monodoc_gtk_DATA to
	prevent an automake error.

2004-11-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* xhtml-provider.cs (GetAbsoluteLink): Avoid munging urls that
	start with our "magic" prefixes, keep them as they are.

2004-11-30  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* configure.in,
	  browser/monodoc.dll.config.in,
	  browser/Makefile.am : Windows build is now available.
	  - Skip browser.exe and dependency check on Windows.
	  - Fixed gacutil installation location.
	  - Rewrite document location in config (it just contains '.')

2004-11-04  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* colorizer.cs: If a language is unrecognized, escape the XML so that it
	  will be properly rendered within monodoc; 
		- Fix ColorizeXml.  Due to an ordering dependency, the regex to colorize
		  double-quoted strings was also replacing the attributes used in a prior
		  substitution (to colorize XML tags).  This garbled the XML, making it
		  unreadable.  Handling double-quoted strings earlier fixes this.
		- Cleanup braces to follow code conventions.

2004-11-01  Richard Torkar <richard.torkar@htu.se>

	* index.cs: Make sure we catch the System.UnauthorizedAccessException 
	that is thrown when the user has no write permissions to store the 
	index file when using "monodoc --make-index".

2004-09-06  Joshua Tauberer  <tauberer@for.net>

	Editing of ECMA-style documentation directly off of the
	"uncompiled" source XML documents.  Invoked with the
	"--local-edit path-to-doc-sources" command line argument, e.g.:
	--local-edit ../class/corlib/en
	
	Some improvements to the way type names and member signatures
	are displayed in links in the ECMA pages.
	
	Some fixes to the way URLs are parsed by the ECMA provider.

2004-08-25  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* provider.cs: Allow a .source file to add nodes to the tree
	with <node> elements. They will automatically be placed below
	the "Various" node. Something of a hack, but needed for more
	complicated third-party docs.

2004-07-31  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* xhtml-provider.cs: Keep a list of the temporary files we

	* xhtml-provider.cs: Take a tocFile parameter telling us which file to load.
	(XhtmlProvider): Pass the tocFile parameter.
	
2004-07-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Index enumeration values and delegates as
	well.  The table of context index on my system is now half the
	size of the actual data.  We need a mechanism to compress data. 

2004-07-15  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* ecmaspec-html.xsl: There are nested lists in the ECMA spec: see ecma334/10.8.xml.
	Support them by iterating on <list>s as well as <list_item>s.

2004-06-30  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* mono-ecma.xsl: you can put an element <since version="blah" />
	below the Docs element of a type or member and it will give
	a notice for what versions it is available in.

2004-06-25  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@ximian.com>

	upgraded monodoc. LastSeenVersion is a new settign for the last

	* ecma-provider.cs:
		Nested types are shown in the type tree as OuterType+InnerType, and lookups were fixed to handle that.
		Namespace nodes now have all of the types within them sorted.
		At run time, the type hierarchy information is inserted into the type XML data based on
		the XML content, so the type hierarchy can be shown without using reflection.
		At the same time, inherited members are dynamically copied into the XML data, if the setting is on.
	* mono-ecma.xsl: The type hierarchy, inherited members support,
	* settings.cs: A setting for showing inherited members in the member listing.
