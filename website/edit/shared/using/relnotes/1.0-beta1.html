<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>Mono Beta 1</h2>

	<p><a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a> is proud to
	introduce the first Beta release of Mono, an open source
	implementation the .NET framework for use on Linux, UNIX
	and Windows System.
	<p>It includes a C# compiler, an implementation of
	the Common Language Infrastructure and
	two stacks of APIs: a UNIX, Linux, <a
	href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>, Mono stack for APIs that
	takes the most advantage of your UNIX server and desktop and a
	set of APIs compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1
	that provides support for <a href="http://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a>

	(web services and web forms), ADO.NET and many other
	components.

	<p>Incorporating key .NET compliant components: a C#
	compiler, and a portable execution system (that includes Just-in-Time
	and pre-compilation support), the Mono Project:

	<ul>
	<li>Provides a superior development environment for writing
	Linux applications with unprecedented productivity.
	
	<li>Allows developers to write rich client, web services and
	server-side applications and deploy them on Linux, Solaris,
	MacOS X, Windows NT/XP and various other UNIX systems on a
	variety of architectures.
	
	<li>Delivers tools that facilitate the creation of product
	APIs and SDKs that are language independent across multiple
	operating systems.
	</ul>

<h2>Current Users</h2>

	<p>Mono is currently being used internally at Novell to
        develop:

	<ul>
	<li> <a
        href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?ifolder">iFolder
        3.0</a>: a file system that provides synchronization,
        peer-to-peer sharing and metadata handling.	
	<li> F-Spot: a photo management application.
	<li> Extensibility for the Nautilus file manager and hooks
        into iFolder.
	</ul>

	<p>Outside of Novell, Mono is being used by many, including
        SourceGear which relies on it to run its <a
        href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault">Vault</a> application
        on Linux and is also what OpenLink's <a
        href="http://www.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/index.htm">Virtuoso</a>
        database uses for its cross platform .NET Runtime Hosting
        functionality.

<a name="goals"></a>
<h2>Beta 1 Release Goals</h2>

	<p>This release is the first of two Mono 1.0 beta releases <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/road-to-1.0.html">planned</a>

	before our final release.</p>
	
        <p>It is the first opportunity for developers outside of the
	contributing community to experience mono on their platform of
	choice. One of our main objective is to make it easy for the
	novice or experienced Linux or Windows developer to start
	building applications on Linux or other platforms right
	away.

	<p>We paid a lot of attention in this release to installation
	and package availability for the following platforms: Red Hat
	9.0, Redhat Fedora Core 1, Novell SUSE 9.0, Novell SUSE SLES 8
	and Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP.
	
	<p>This release is the first to see a split of Mono in thirty
	or so packages that allows for better distribution
	granularity.  Meta-packages are available as well as some
	preview packages for 2.0 features such as System.Windows.Forms
	support.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, Mono 1.0 Beta 1 is the first release to
	include the Global Assembly Cache.</p>
	
	<p>Just like any Beta release, we welcome any bug report and
	suggestions.</p>

	<p><b>Dependencies</b>
	
	<p>If you are installing from source code, there are a few
	 optional dependencies that you will want to consider
	 installing.
        
	<blockquote>
	 <p><b>icu 2.6.1</b> Optional: for supporting string collation.
	 <p><b>Cairo 0.1.22</b> Required to install libgdiplus.
	</blockquote>

	
	<p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>
        
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	source code is very simple (MacOS X users, read the rest of
	the notes):
	 <p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-0.91.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-0.91
    $ ./configure
    $ make install
	
</pre>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Optional Packages</b><p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>Libgdiplus and WineLib are optional packages, you only need
	those if you intent to use System.Drawing and Windows.Forms
	respectively.
	
	<p>libgdiplus:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf libgdiplus-0.5.tar.gz
    $ cd libgdiplus-0.5
    $ /configure
    $ make install
	
</pre>
	<p>For WineLib, it is necessary first to install a Wine
	 package from <a href="http://www.winehq.com">Wine HQ</a>, and
	 once that is installed, you can install the WineLib package,
	 which is now just an extension to Wine instead of a
	 modification to Wine:
	 <pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf winelib-0.2.tar.gz
    $ cd winelib-0.2.tar.gz
    $ ./configure
    $ make install
	

</pre>

<h2>Changes since the 0.31 release.<img src='/img/new.gif'>
</h2>

	The following is a list of changes since the Mono 0.31
	release:

	<h3>Generics, Generics, Generics <img src='/img/mono-exclusive.gif'></h3> 


	<p>This release implements the latest ECMA generics: its
	supported in both the C# compiler and the virtual machine.
	This is the first implementation outside of Microsoft.

	<p>To use this, you must install the preview packages (if
	using packages), or configure mono with the --with-preview=yes
	(if compiling from source code).  That will install the 2.0
	set of assemblies which includes the generics classes. 

	<p>The generics compiler is called `gmcs' as opposed to the
	standard 1.0 compiler `mcs'.  
	
	<h3>Runtime</h3>

	<p>The major change in this release is that Mono now has a
        Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  The gacutil tool is now
        functional, and the runtime will pick assemblies from that
        directory (it will still pick assemblies from MONO_PATH, but
        we encourage you to strong name your assemblies and install
        them on the GAC).

	<p>The GAC introduction means that assemblies must be
        installed on it, and also be exposed to the compiler, this is
        done automatically for Mono libraries and for Gtk# libraries,
        but third party libraries will have to use a -lib: argument to
        the compiler.

	<p>To assist developers, we have added a -package flag to
        gacutil that does this for you automatically, like this:

	<xmp class="shell">
    bash$ gacutil -i MyLib.dll -package MyLib
	</xmp>

	<p>It is now possible to include the dll to shared library
	remapping next to the assembly instead of registering all the
	mappings with the mono/etc/config.  This allows developers to
	remap the P/Invoke libraries without having to modify the
	system configuration.  The configuration file is just a
	.config file next to the assembly.

	<h3>Java and IKVM <img src='/img/mono-exclusive.gif'></h3>

	<p>We have now integrated the JNI engine from Zoltan Varga to
	run IKVM out of the box with Mono, the packages include the
        JNI support as well as a Java VM: <tt>ikvm</tt>, you can run
        Java applications like this:

	<xmp class="shell">

    bash$ ikvm -cp app.jar org.demo.Main
	</xmp>

	<p>Please visit the <a href="http://weblog.ikvm.net/">IKVM
        site</a> for more information.

	<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>Marek Safar contributed the CLS support to the C# compiler:
        now our C# compiler will properly flag errors where CLS
        compliance is not met as well as contributing a large test
        suite for these errors.
	
	<p>Assembly signing: as part of our move to support the GAC,
        Sebastien Pouliot added the delaysign[+|-], /keyfile and
        /keycontainer options like CSC 8.x. and support to the
        compiler to sign assemblies and delay sign assemblies.
	
	<p>The long missing support for generating pinned variables
        (used by the fixed statement) has been finally implemneted
        (thanks to Ben Maurer).

	<p>Raja Harinath and Ben also improved our regression test
        suite to log errors, and to better track the negative error
        test suite.

	<h3>Cryptography and Security <img src='/img/mono-exclusive.gif'></h3>

	<p>On systems lacking /dev/random as a source of good random
	data, Bernie Solomon provided support for egd/prngd to get
	random data from.

	<p>Sebastien Pouliot did a few things: updated the support for
        System.Security.Principal. WindowsIdentity,WindowsImpersonationContext
        and WindowsPrincipal are now implemented and work on both
        Windows and Linux.

	<p>Key pairs containers are now secured on creation and their access
	control is also checked before being used. Key pair persistance is
	automatic only when a CspParameter object is used in the constructors of
	[DSA|RSA]CryptoServiceProvider.

	<p>Mono.Security.dll has been FxCop-ized and is now CLS
        compliant.

	<p>Carlos Guzmán continued his work on our managed SSL/TLS
        implementation, now it support for exportable ciphers.

	<p>Atsushi Enomoto improved the XML Signature classes: Now it
	passes many of the tests in W3C "merlin" and "phaos"
	compatibility test suite (except for some missing stuff such
	as XPath here()), including prefixed XML instance and Manifest element.
	
	<p>Xml Digital Signature (System.Security.dll) now pass all 15
        tests in Merlin's suite. Microsoft implementation only pass 14
        out of 15.

	<p>22 tests from the Phaos suite (out of 28 tests) also pass
        (note that 4 failures are due to unavailable algorithms in Fx
        1.1, like HMACMD5 and exclusive C14N). Microsoft's
        implementation scores 0 on this suite due to C14N bugs.

	<h3>JIT ports <img src='/img/mono-exclusive.gif'></h3>

	<p>Neale Ferguson has contributed a code generator port for the
	IBM S390 architecture.

	<p>Paolo Molaro got the PowerPC port to completely self host,
	many bugs have been fixed and is getting closer to the state
	of the x86 JIT engine.  Larger applications like MonoDoc and
	MonoDevelop run out of the box.

	<p>Zoltan Varga has improved the SPARC port, and its now on
	par with the x86 port with the exception of Thread.Abort.

	<h3>System.Data</h3>

	<p>Juraj Skripsky contributed a new SQL expression parser and
	evaluator for the DataTable's Select and Compute methods, it
	fixes several bugs, and is on par feature wise with the
	services offered by .NET's implementation.

	<p>Atsushi Enomoto completed various missing pieces in
	System.Data to support fully the xsd.exe functionality.
        TypedDataSetGenerator is implemented and it can generate
        simple dataset that does not have relations.  With existing
        data loader, DataSet.InferXmlSchema() is also implemented to
        accept .xml files in xsd.exe.

	<p>From Francisco Figueiredo: Npgsql now reports all
        informations about server errors, like, error number, file and
        severity. Note that this is only available in 7.4+ server
        versions.

	<h3>New Interpreter <img src='/img/mono-exclusive.gif'></h3>

	<p>Bernie Solomon contributed a new implementation of the Mono
	interpreter.  The new interpreter creates a new intermediate
	representation for the code it executes which avoids the
	expensive metadata lookups as well as caching plenty of
	information that before we had to track manually.

	<p>The new interpreter is on average three times faster than
	the old interpreter, which makes it suitable to use on
	platforms where the JIT was not available, and the old engine
	was too slow to be useful for large projects.

	<h3>Performance</h3>

	<p>Atsushi Enomoto made the DTD parser two times faster and
	consume half the memory it used to before.

	<p>Andreas Nahr improved the performance of many core classes
        like Char.

	<p>Ben Maurer did a number of performance related
        improvements: reduced the size of our vtables by removing
        non-virtual methods from them;  Tuned the C# compiler to
        produce better code for loops and various other constructs
        (smaller code, and it also assists the JIT);  More efficient
        code is now generated for String.Concat;  Redundant code in the JIT
        removed; 

	<h3>Internationalization</h3>

	<p>ICU is no longer a requirement to run most applications
        thanks to Jackson Harper: Mono now includes the datatables for
        international information directly into the runtime
        (Calendars, days of the week, names of days, punctuation,
        number formating, date formating, etc).

	<p>ICU is still required if you need string collation
        functionality.
	
	<h3>JScript and VB.NET</h3>

	<p>Mainsoft contributed its runtime for Visual Basic written
        in Java, and a large collection of test suites for the Basic
        environment.  Various developers started the porting effort to
        get the runtime rewritten in C#.

	<p>Cesar Lopez continued his work on the JScript engine,
        conditional statements, while and do statmeents and
        short-circuit statements are in.

	<h3>Windows Forms, System.Drawing</h3>

	<p>Jordi, Ravindra and Sanjay have been hard at work to
        complete the System.Drawing API built on Cairo and FreeType2,
        it is mostly feature complete at this point.

	<p>Peter Bartok has continued his work on Windows.Forms, and
        many more applications run, most of the basic tests are now
        operational, and he is working now in a control-per-control
        basis to complete it.
	
	<h3>Bug fixing, completion</h3>

	<p>On System.XML: There were many bugfixes that came from the
	Mainsoft developers: C# port of NIST DOM test collection, Gert
	Driesen's NDoc on Mono challenge (now NDocConsole.exe is
	usable on Mono), xmldsig improvements.

	<p>Jean-Marc Andre checked in a new Soap formatter for
        Remoting, which addresses many problems.

	<p>Lluis Sanchez fixed many bugs in our WebServices stack as
        well as fixing many problems with connection pooling in
        Mono.Data.Tds and its user classes (SQL server access).

	<p>Eric Durand fixed a long standing set of problems with our
        Regular Expression's implementation (parse and interpret
        Balancing construct as expected).

	<p>Finalizers were not running in version 0.31, this release
        fixes that problem

<a name="known"></a>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<h3>MacOS X</h3>

	<h4>Need Boehm GC 6.3alpha5</h4>

	<p>The bundled Boehm GC does not work on MacOS X, you must
	obtain the latest release the Boehm GC from:

	<a
	href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/</a>

	<p>We strongly recommend this version: <a
	href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/gc6.3alpha5.tar.gz">gc6.3alpha5.tar.gz</a>

	<p>It is very important that you configure the Boehm with
	thread support set to `pthreads', like this:

	<xmp class="shell">
	./configure --enable-threads=pthreads
	</xmp>

	<p>Failure to do so will result in random crashes and
	behavior.

	<h4>Gtk# applications fail to start with `Cannot open font file for font Verdana 12'</h4>

	<p>This is only an issue if you are executing Gtk+
	applications remotely from MacOS X.  To solve this, use the
	following workaround:

	<xmp class="shell">
	export GDK_USE_XFT=0
	</xmp>

	<h4>IL assembler produces incorrect code</h4>

	<p>Will be fixed in an upcoming release.

<h2>Logging Bugs Against Mono</h2>

	<p>One of our main goal for releasing Beta software is of
	course to encourage developers to use our software and help us
	make it a stable, feature complete and reliable system. In
	order to achieve that goal, we ask you to report bugs as you
	find them. For this, you will need to create a <a
	href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/createaccount.cgi">Bugzilla
	Account</a>.
	
	<p>Here are some convenient shortcuts to browse or add bug reports.

<h3>How to make good bug reports</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Submit a test case, the smaller, the better.
<p>
<li>Use <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">
		http://bugzilla.ximian.com</a> to report the bug.
		
		<p>In <b>addition</b> to bugzilla, posting to the list is
		fine if the bug merits larger exposure or design
		discussions to solve; posting to the list twice or more
		is just a way to annoy people and make them waste time,
		specially when you start a new thread about it.

<p>
<li>If the test involves libraries or assemblies that are
		not part of mono, add infomation on where to download all
		dependencies, and how to compile/install them.
<p>
<li>If compiling the test case requires more than:
		<pre> mcs test.cs </pre>
		provide the <b>full command line</b> you used to compile
		the test.
<p>
<li>If running the test requires more than:
		<pre> mono test.exe </pre>

		provide the <b>full command line</b> needed to replicate
		the bug.
<p>
<li>Provide info about the version of the software you're
		using (both mono and the operating system or relevant
		libraries).
<p>
<li>Provide the output you expect the test case to produce.
		
<li>Provide the actual output <b>you</b> get from the test case.
</ol>
<p>
 Please include at least 6 items from the list in your bug report.  Incomplete bug reports are very hard to understand, reproduce and  fix.
